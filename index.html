    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I Have many aspirations and hope to succeed in all that my inspirations
            may lead me, driven through my adventorous fearless spirit. 
            I hope to find the right place for me in the career field. 
            I have delved into the subject of computer sciene with minimal prior 
            experience and aim to navigate through this current system to search 
            for my rightful throne.</li>
        <li>I aim to succeed in my creative pursuits with my poetic nature and eye
            for the natural world. I aim to gain a higher level of mindfulness with the 
            rapid evolving fast paced nature of the world system. 
            Paving a journey closer to my spiritual desires and loved souls.
        </li>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have experience in poetry through my own eye and inner-wisdom; 
            with the help of AP literature during my senior year I was also 
            able to further enchance my skills throughout the school year and reach a
            place of trailblazing to the listener. Through my art I aim to encapsulate 
            enlightening words inspiring a fire of undying hope and compassion similar to 
            artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Smino.  </li>
        
            <li>I adore fashioning myself in great looking styles which I feel encapsulates 
                a great part of the characters in my personaility whilst still maintaining true to my inner-self. </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2>Interests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I love engaging into the mind and delving into dimensions beyond this 3D matrix.
             Diving deep into the intricacies of our thoughts and their symbolistic meanings 
             which we pass by without further understanding of the root of our behavioral mind. 
             Engaging in mindfulness to navigate through our complex multidimensional mind</li>
        
             <li>I have a great interest in theology which I believe is a root to a great understanding 
            of the world around us and its effects on our daily life </li>
